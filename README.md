CSI 3140 Assignment 2: Wordle in HTML/CSS/JS

Wordle is a guessing game where players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word. At every guess, they receive feedback that lets them know how close they are to the correct word. The feedback involves a color for each letter in the guessed word that lets the player know if that letter is (Green) in the final word in the correct position, (Yellow) in the final word but in the incorrect position, or (Gray) not in the final word.

Example:

Word: Apple
Guess: Range

Feedback: 

The word contains the letter "A" but in a different position (Yellow)
The word contains the letter "E" in the same position (Green)
All other letters are not contained in the word (Gray)
